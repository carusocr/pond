1. Fix heatmap-first bug...check if heatmap object exists, if not, go ahead and marker up. Otherwise, null out heatmap overlay first. Right now I'm just trying to null it.
*Or, toggle buttons...show/hide for both*
2. Center map on average lat/long of points loaded.
*DONE, BUT ADJUST ZOOM LEVEL MORE EFFECTIVELY*
*ADDITIONAL BUG - 0,0 POINT?*
3. Get lat/long infobox for each marker.
*working on infoboxes*
4. Load actual JSON data instead of simple coordinate pair.
5. Active listening for tweets...this is the big step. How to connect my ruby scripts and this?
