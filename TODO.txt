1. Figure out why I need to select a file twice before it shows up in input text.
*FIXED*
1. Fix heatmap-first bug...check if heatmap object exists, if not, go ahead and marker up. Otherwise, null out heatmap overlay first. Right now I'm just trying to null it.
2. Center map on average lat/long of points loaded.
3. Get lat/long infobox for each marker.
4. Load actual tweets in infobox?
5. Active listening for tweets...this is the big step. How to connect my ruby scripts and this?
